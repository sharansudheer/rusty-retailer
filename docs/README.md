Powered by Rust and heaps of Coffee, let's get into the main event, shall we 😁 :-

* Building a fully fledged Retail Store Management Solution that can be deployed in Cloud or locally.
* This is just a town/tip of An Iceberg, or what seems like an Empire (not Umpire) run by an Emperor and Empress. With the Help of Department of Homeland Security, Director of National Intelligence, Department of Justice(Auditor, etc, still in progress) and Social Security Administration. For more information, visit [repofans.com](https://www.repofans.com) 😉(once the website is live).
* Note - This or the one in repofans will not be a commercial product, just an example about how Humour and Software Research and Development can be integrated without being blatantly obvious. Just trying to push the boundaries of what is possible and not.
*   Being developed with security as one of the core motive by using Identity and Access Management and

    business logic to prevent erroneous database operations and loss of software control by at least 50%. This will have to be manually blended in using actix-identity and other libraries(probably).
* Implemented with Scalability in mind ensuring that the proof of concept - Modular Monolith Architecture can be broken down into a Microservices Architecture if necessary by building the back-end application and front-end application separately using Docker and maintaining separation of concerns in the core back-end.
* Designed to ensure minimal loss of data by preventing single point of failure, node failure by maintaining hot cache, logs and decentralised copy.
* Core Motivation being to feel how a President orchestrates a Government and the Country in a very scaled down manner, Research and Understand how the Documentation, Logging, Monitoring-Intel gathering, Database Operations, Database Decentralisation, Identity and Access Management, Cache layer, Data Sanitation, Basic Security, Modularity and Scalability works all in one package.
